Documentation


1. Predefined saved searches
The predefined searches in this app are meant as templates for license monitoring.

All prediction searches are based on the consumption of the past 7 days.
This value can be adjusted via the splunk UI or in file savedsearches.conf.
An Alert action should be added to all saved searches. We recommend using E-mail notifications.
